# Design Principles for Playful Garden

## UI/UX Design Principles

### 1. Visual Hierarchy
- I prioritize important elements through size, color, and positioning
- The dashboard layout focuses on the garden map as the primary element
- Secondary elements like weather widgets and panels are sized appropriately
- Navigation elements are consistently positioned for easy access

### 2. Color Theory
- I use a nature-inspired palette centered on greens, earth tones, and complementary colors
- Primary actions use distinct colors (like green-700) for recognition
- I maintain sufficient contrast ratios for readability and accessibility
- Background colors are subtle (green-50, white) to let content stand out

### 3. Typography
- I use a consistent type hierarchy with clear size differences between headings and body text
- Text colors are selected for readability (dark green for headings, darker colors for body text)
- Font weights are used to create emphasis (bold for headings, regular for body text)
- Line spacing is optimized for readability

### 4. Responsive Design
- I implement a mobile-first approach that scales up to desktop views
- Layouts use Flexbox and Grid for adaptable content organization
- ResizablePanels allow users to customize their workspace on larger screens
- UI elements are sized appropriately for touch interfaces

### 5. Interaction Design
- I provide visual feedback for all interactive elements
- Transitions and animations are subtle and purposeful
- Interactive components have obvious hover/focus states
- Complex interactions (like drag and drop in the garden map) have clear visual cues

### 6. Consistency
- UI components maintain consistent styling throughout the application
- Navigation patterns remain consistent across different sections
- Spacing and alignment follow a consistent grid system
- Iconography uses a cohesive style (Lucide React)

## Technical Design Principles

### 1. Component Architecture
- I create small, focused components with single responsibilities
- Components are organized by feature and reusability
- I use composition to build complex interfaces from simple parts
- Common patterns are extracted into reusable components

### 2. State Management
- Local state is used for component-specific concerns
- Context is applied for theme, authentication, and cross-cutting concerns
- React Query handles server state with caching and synchronization
- State updates follow immutable patterns

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Components are memoized when appropriate to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Large lists implement virtualization for performance
- Code splitting is applied for larger feature sets
- Assets are optimized for fast loading

### 4. Accessibility
- I ensure keyboard navigation works throughout the application
- ARIA attributes are applied appropriately
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- Text alternatives are provided for non-text content

### 5. Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages appear as toast notifications
- Fallback UI states exist for data loading failures
- Error boundaries prevent cascading failures
- Form validation provides clear feedback

## Areas I've Identified for Improvement

1. Some components have grown too large (TasksContent.tsx, GardenAdvisor.tsx)
2. Certain UI elements could benefit from more consistent spacing
3. Mobile responsiveness could be enhanced in the garden mapping interface
4. Dark mode support is incomplete in some components
5. Error handling could be more comprehensive in data-fetching scenarios
